The main requirements has been implemented but there is still room for improvement.

# Possible improvement
- The UI needs some polishing especially the tablet view. The grids needs some more tweaking. 
- The tablet view is a split between the list and detail, it can be improved with motion layout to animate the detail to slide from right with a comic is selected from the list.
- Didn't have enough time to implement ability to have the app work offline. This can be done with Room database to store the list of comics when fetch from the api.
- Add UI test cases
